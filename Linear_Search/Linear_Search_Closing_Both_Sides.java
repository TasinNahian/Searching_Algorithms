// Given an array arr[] of n elements, the task is to write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

// Examples :  

// Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 110;
// Output : 6
// Explaination: Element x is present at index 6

// Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 175;
// Output : -1
// Explaination: Element x is not present in arr[].


//Why search from both sides? -  more faster to find the value since 
// 2 if statements are executed in a single loop
